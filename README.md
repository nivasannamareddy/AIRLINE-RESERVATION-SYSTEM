## Project Overview
The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is a complete end-to-end project developed as part of the Systems Analysis and Project Management course.  
It demonstrates the entire System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirements analysis and system design to project management and implementation planning.

The goal of this project is to modernize the airline booking process by improving operational efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. The system integrates AI-driven recommendations and implements robust information security practices. Project management principles such as WBS, Gantt Chart, and Risk Analysis were applied throughout the development process.

## Project Objectives
- Automate the airline booking, cancellation, and ticket management processes.  
- Enhance user experience through a streamlined interface and secure transactions.  
- Apply structured analysis and design techniques for system modeling.  
- Integrate AI components for predictive pricing and smart recommendations.  
- Incorporate information security mechanisms to protect customer data.  
- Manage project scope, resources, and timelines using WBS and Gantt charts.
